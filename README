# Project Summary

This project aims to develop a Retriever-Augmented Generator (RAG) model that can parse PDF documents and provide information retrieval capabilities in a chatbox interface using OpenAI's APIs. 
The goal is to enable users to ask questions and receive responses directly derived from the content within the PDFs, facilitating an interactive and dynamic way of accessing information.

## Python Environment Setup

To set up the Python environment for this project, follow these steps:

1. Install Python: If you don't have Python installed, download and install the latest version from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Create a virtual environment: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory. Run the following command to create a virtual environment:

```shell
python -m venv env
```

This will create a new directory named `env` which will contain the Python environment for your project.

3. Activate the virtual environment: Depending on your operating system, run the appropriate command to activate the virtual environment:

- For Windows:

  ```shell
  .\env\Scripts\activate
  python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
  ```

- For macOS/Linux:

  ```shell
  source env/bin/activate
  ```

4. Install project dependencies: Once the virtual environment is activated, you can install the required dependencies for your project. Typically, this is done by using a package manager like pip. Run the following command to install the dependencies listed in your project's requirements.txt file:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Replace `requirements.txt` with the actual name of your requirements file if it's different.

## Conclusion

pypdf may not be the best robust package to use when it comes to reading pdf from journals due toe some formatting issue. Will have to tryout more robust packages.
